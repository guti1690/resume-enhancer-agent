My name is Elvin Gutierrez. I'm a software developer with focus on Frontend development. I'm originally from Managua, Nicaragua.
I love all kind of foods, chinesse food, seafood and my favorite food is "Nacatamal" (a local variant of a tamal). I love to play video games in my PC,
watch soccer, follow and use FOSS software and recently I started learning about Agentic AI.

In my website/blog I usually write about what I learn based on my experiences in development and GNU/Linux. My blog is used by myself as
future references when I don't remember how to do something. Usually what I write is not too common or usual, so hopefully the content will
be useful for other users. Also, another goal of the blog is to help people that speaks in Spanish so there are variants of the posts in Spanish.

Currently I'm working on my own projects, to be able to optimize my workflow and automate repetitive tasks while learning about AI.

I'm no longer an AppSumo employee, and I'm open to new opportunities.
